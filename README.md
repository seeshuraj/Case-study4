# Multigrid Solver for 2D Poisson Equation

This Case study implements a **Multigrid (MG) method** to solve the 2D Poisson equation using a recursive V-cycle with weighted Jacobi smoothing. The convergence behavior is visualized and benchmarked across different grid sizes.

---

## Features

- V-cycle multigrid implementation with adjustable levels
- Weighted Jacobi smoother
- Full-weighting restriction and bilinear prolongation
- Convergence plots and benchmark comparisons
- CSV output of cycles, residuals, and timings
- Ready-to-run and extensible Python code

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `mg_solver.py` | Main Python script to run the multigrid solver |
| `mg_convergence.png` | Log plot showing convergence over V-cycles |
| `mg_comparison_results.csv` | Benchmark results for various grid sizes |

##  How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the solver:
   ```bash
   python3 mg_solver.py
   ```

   It will output residuals per cycle and generate `mg_convergence.png`.

## Benchmarking

The script runs V-cycle multigrid for various grid sizes (`N = 16, 32, 64, 128, 256`) using:
- 2-Level MG
- Max-level MG (deepest possible)

Results are saved in:
```
mg_comparison_results.csv
```
