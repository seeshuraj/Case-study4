# ðŸ§® Multigrid Solver for 2D Poisson Equation

## âœ… Problem Description

This assignment implements and benchmarks a **Multigrid V-cycle solver** for the 2D Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the unit square. It includes:

- 5-point stencil Laplacian matrix
- Weighted Jacobi smoothing
- Restriction and prolongation (multigrid operators)
- Recursive V-cycle implementation
- Convergence benchmark across multiple grid sizes

## âœ… Benchmark Results Summary and Observations

### ðŸ“Š Multigrid Benchmark Summary

The solver was benchmarked across increasing grid sizes `N = [16, 32, 64, 128, 256]`, comparing two configurations:

- **2-Level Multigrid (lmax = 1)**  
- **Max-Level Multigrid (lmax = logâ‚‚(N/8))**

| Grid Size (N) | 2-Level Cycles | 2-Level Time (s) | Final Residual | Max-Level Cycles | Max-Level Time (s) | Final Residual |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| 16            | 26             | 0.01             | 6.62e-08       | 26               | 0.01               | 6.62e-08       |
| 32            | 29             | 0.03             | 6.02e-08       | 50               | 0.04               | 7.78e-07       |
| 64            | 30             | 0.10             | 6.51e-08       | 50               | 0.12               | 4.63e-02       |
| 128           | 31             | 0.75             | 5.45e-08       | 50               | 0.93               | 9.37e+00       |
| 256           | 32             | 2.73             | 5.01e-08       | 50               | 3.47               | 1.91e+02       |

### ðŸ“Œ Key Observations

1. âœ… **2-Level MG performs better** as `N` increases:
   - It consistently **converges faster** (fewer cycles).
   - Achieves **lower residuals** for the same tolerance.

2. ðŸ“‰ **Max-Level MG underperforms for large `N`**:
   - At `N = 256`, the final residual is ~191 compared to just `5e-8` for 2-level.
   - Suggests **overhead from many levels** reduces effectiveness without aggressive smoothing or coarse correction.

3. ðŸ’¡ **Time vs. Accuracy Trade-off**:
   - 2-Level MG is **more efficient** in practice for the given smoothing strategy.
   - While more levels might help with memory, they may hurt convergence unless tuned properly.

4. ðŸ§  **Residuals drop exponentially** in successful cases:
   - Verified visually via the `mg_convergence.png` plot.
   - Indicates textbook multigrid convergence behavior.

## âœ… Learning Reflection

> Through this assignment, I gained a deep, hands-on understanding of the **multigrid method** and why it is one of the most efficient solvers for elliptic PDEs like the Poisson equation.  
> 
> Initially, I underestimated the implementation complexity â€” especially how important **restriction, prolongation**, and **smoothing** were for performance. I realized that just adding more levels does not guarantee faster convergence.  
> 
> Profiling the solver on increasing grid sizes helped me understand **how memory usage scales (O(NÂ²))** and where practical performance bottlenecks lie.  
> 
> Most importantly, seeing the **exponential residual drop** on the semilog plot gave me confidence in the correctness of my implementation.
